"""
This sub deals with the higher-level logic related to downloading of distfiles. Where the 'fetch.py'
sub deals with grabbing HTTP data from APIs, this is much more geared towards grabbing tarballs that
are bigger, and organizing them into a distfiles directory. This includes calculating cryptographic
hashes on the resultant downloads and ensuring they match what we expect.

The implementation is based around a class called `Download`.

Why do we have a class called 'Download'? Imagine we have an autogen, and it has two Artifacts
referencing the same file (this can and does happen.) Do we want to download the same file twice?
No -- it would be far better if we downloaded the file once, and then provided the results to
each Artifact, saying in effect 'here is the file you wanted to download.' This is why the
Download class exists.

Because autogen uses asyncio, it's possible for two autogens to try downloading the same file
at the same time. If they create a `Download` object, this special class will do the magic of looking
for any active downloads of the same file, and if one exists, it will not fire
off a new download but instead wait for the existing download to complete. So the 'downloader'
(code trying to download the file) can remain ignorant of the fact that the download was already
started previously.

Locking Code
============

The locking code below deserves some explanation. DL_ACTIVE tracks all the active downloads for
*all* threads that are running. DL_ACTIVE_LOCK is a lock we use to access this dictionary, when
we want to read or modify it.

DOWNLOAD_SLOT is the mechanism we used to ensure we only have a certain number (specified by the
value= parameter) of downloads active at once. Each active download will acquire a slot. When all
slots are exhausted, any pending downloads will wait for an active slot before they can begin.
"""

	This code originally tried to do this, but it would deadlock::

	This code ^^ will deadlock as hit the max semaphore value. The reason? When we hit the max value, it will block
	for a download slot in the current thread will FREEZE our thread's ioloop, which will prevent another asyncio
	task from executing which needs to *release* the download slot -- thus the deadlock.

	So instead of using this approach, we will attempt to acquire a download slot in a non-blocking fashion. If we
	succeed -- great. If not, we will asyncio loop to repeatedly attempt to acquire the slot with a slight delay
	between each attempt. This ensures that the ioloop can continue to function and release any download slots while
	we wait.

	When we need to download an artifact, we create a download. Multiple, co-existing Artifact
	objects can reference the same file. Rather than have them try to download the same file
	at the same time, they leverage a "Download" which eliminates conflicts and manages the
	retrieval of the file.

	The Download object will record all Artifacts that need this file, and arbitrate the download
	of this file and update the Artifacts with the completion data when the download is complete.

	A Download will be shared only if the Artifacts fetching the file are storing it as the same
	final_name. So it's possible that if the final_name differs that files could be theoretically
	downloaded multiple times or simultaneously and redundantly (but this rarely if ever happens,
	just worth mentioning and a possible improvement in the future.)
